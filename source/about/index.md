## About Me ##

I love travelling, photography, tennis, cooking and varied style of music. 

I have two Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and Internation Trade and Business, two Master's degree in Civil Engineering and Computer Science, and one Docorate degree in Urban Planning, which I am in pursuit of.

My best interest is machine learning, statistics and optimization. This blog will share with everyone about my knowledge of machine learning, statistics, optimization and other interesting stuff like the following photo I took when I traveled to Sarasota Beach, FL.
